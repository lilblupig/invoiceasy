## UX

### **Overview and Broad Design Choices**
The premise of InvoicEasy is to allow small businesses of all types to make use of a simple system.  As such, the design should appeal to as broad an audience as possible in terms of age and gender.  Finance systems are not known for being exciting to look at and are instead functional with as clean an interface as possible.

### **User Stories**
1. As a new user, I want to learn quickly what InvoicEasy is, and how it can help me.
1. As a new user, I want to follow as simple a process as possible to sign up, having chosen my plan.
1. As a new user, I want to intuitively understand how the system works, and get started right away.
1. As a returning user, I want to see my existing customers and invoices readily, so I don't duplicate input.
1. As a returning user, I want to be able to resend invoices quickly to customers who have not yet paid.
1. As a frequent user, I want to be able to see and manage my subscription information.
1. As a frequent user, I want to be able to see and manage my own business information.

These stories are addressed fully in the [Testing](TESTING.md) document.

### **Strategy**
**Who is the website for?** <br>
Any and all small businesses looking to move from a postal system, which cannot afford or justify big accounts packages.

**What does the owner of the website need/want?**
The owner wants to:
1. Make life easier for small businesses at as low cost as possible.
1. Meet the costs of maintaining and hosting the website, with the possibility of extending features and plans in the future.

**What do the users of the website need/want?**
1. Simple, easy to use system.
1. Low cost.
1. Manage customers.
1. Manage invoices.
1. Manage subscription.
1. Manage own data.

**Broadly, how does the website meet these needs?**

Owner aims:
1. By providing a no-frills type service which addresses a very specific need in terms of finance record keeping.  Focussing on one particular function and nothing else. 
2. The cost of the subscriptions can be used to cover hosting costs as the service grows and maintain the site.

User aims:
1. The system is designed with as few decorative items as possible, whilst retaining an image on each page for visual relief.  This means the UI is front and center for the user and should be easy to understand.
1. The subscriptions are priced to beat the cost of sending 5 invoices by mail each month.
1. There is a clear customer form for adding and editing customers.
1. There is a clear invoice form for inputting fees.
1. The subscription information is displayed on the dashboard at all times.
1. There is a subscriber profile which is editable, and accessible directly from the nav.

### **Scope**
Why does the website exist?  What does it need to meet the user/owner aims?
<br>
The website exists because currently, there is no scheme which caters to microbusinesses.  The likes of Sage, Xero and Quickbooks all have extensive features around expenses, payroll, reporting and VAT management and are priced accordingly.

##### Summary of Changes
* 

### **Surface**

#### Colours
The colours chosen are based on making the UI as clean and intuitive as possible.  A dark grey was chosen as the main colour and is used for nav, footer and the majority of body text.<br><br>
A bright orange was chosen as the highlight colour as warmer colours draw the attention better than cooler colours, and should therefore stand out more to the user as call to action items.  Red was not chosen because of negative connotations within the realms of finance, and a general association with danger/threat.<br><br>
The complimentary colours are all cool blues, with the intent to use for secondary buttons, hover colours etc.<br><br>
![Colours option 1](documentation/readme-images/colors-opt-1.png)

#### Typography
Only one font was really chosen for the site as the accent, for headers, logos and other items that need to stand out.  It was decided to proceed with the standard font used by Bootstrap for the majority of the body etc, as the creators will have chosen a suitably inclusive and easy to read design.
1. The accent font chosen was [Flamenco](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Flamenco?preview.text=InvoicEasy&preview.text_type=custom) since it provides a stark contrast to the standard font used in Bootstrap 5, without being overly fussy or indicative of age or gender.

## Testing

This information is held in the [Testing](TESTING.md) file.

## Development Life Cycle

This section is to provide an brief insight into how the approach to the code structure of the website was expected to work, what changed and why, and then to summarise how the creator would now approach replicating the project.

Changes to design are documented in the [UX section](#ux) under [wireframes](#wireframes).

The project was deployed using GitHub pages once the basic structure of the page was complete.  This allowed for continuous delivery as each change was made, and pushed and enabled testing of the page during development on different devices.

Commits were made as each section of each page was added and pushed once a section was complete.

### **Reflections on General Approach to Build**
What would be done differently next time?  What went right?  Overall opinion.

### **Lessons Learned**

### **Revised Development Process**

Based on the experience of producing the website, the creator would now take the following approach.

#### Preparation


#### Build

## Deployment

The website was created using [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/). Version control was undertaken by committing to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and pushing to [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the functions within GitPod.  [Heroku]((https://heroku.com/)) was used to deploy the live site.

### **Deployment of the Page**
Continuous deployment via GitHub-Heroku link was utilised for this project.  As such, deployment was amongst the first tasks undertaken.
1. In the IDE, ensure that a small test application exists, and all changes are committed and pushed to GitHub.
1. Create a requirements file, which will be used by Heroku in creation of the deployment.
    * In the terminal, type "pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt".
    * Commit this to Git.
1. Create a Procfile, which is used by Heroku to determine the language for the app.
    * In the terminal, type "echo web: python app.py > Procfile".
    * This is case sensitive, and should have a capital P, and should have no file extension.
    * Commit this to Git.
1. Push these files to GitHub.
1. [Sign in to Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) (or [create a Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/) if you do not already have one), and choose "New > Create New App".
![Heroku Dashboard snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-1.png)
1. Choose an app name, which must be unique, and select the nearest region.  Then click "Create App".
![Heroku new app snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-2.png)
1. Once generated choose the "Deploy" tab, select "Connect to GitHub" sub-tab and click the "Connect to GitHub" button.
![Heroku Deploy snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-3.png)
![Heroku GitHub snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-4.png)
1. Follow the on-screen instructions to link Heroku to your GitHub account.
1. Click the "Settings" tab from the main menu, and scroll down to find "Reveal Config Vars".  This section should be populated with any sensitive data which is not appropriate to send to GitHub, usually in an "env.py" document.
![Heroku GitHub snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-vars.png)
1. Back on the Deploy tab, once linked, Heroku will prompt for the repository name, complete this and click "Search".
![Heroku GitHub snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-5.png)
1. The repo listing should appear, click "Connect".
1. Heroku will process the request before showing that the connection has been made successfully, and showing two new options.  Click the first of these, which is to "Enable Automatic Deploys".
![Heroku GitHub snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-6.png)
1. The second option is to "Deploy Branch".  Click the button and Heroku will process for some time.
![Heroku GitHub snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-7.png)
1. Once complete, Heroku will display a checklist, followed by a "View" button.  Click this to open the app in a new tab.
![Heroku GitHub snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-8.png)
1. Celebrate! Your app should now update in line with any changes pushed to GitHub.

### **How to Clone and Run the Code Locally**
There are slightly different approaches should you choose to use GitPod to clone the project, or a local IDE.

#### Cloning a Project into GitPod
1. Use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/). *(This can also be undertaken in Firefox)*
1. If you do not already have one, [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
1. Install the [GitPod browser extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki). *(Or Firefox if appropriate)*
1. Restart Chrome.
1. In GitHub, find the [project repository](https://github.com/ci-14-task-manager).
1. From the repository menu, choose the green GitPod button.
![GitPod button snip](documentation/readme-images/cloning-gitpod.png)
1. A new GitPod workspace will open containing the project code.

#### Cloning a Project into a Local IDE
1. Navigate to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ci-14-task-manager).
1. Choose the Code dropdown menu, and copy the URL.
![GitHub code download snip](documentation/readme-images/clone-local-ide.png)
1. Open your local IDE and then open a terminal.
1. Set the current working directory to your preferred location for the cloned project.
1. Type in "git clone " followed by the copied URL. Be sure to include a space between git clone and the url, then press enter.
1. The cloned project will be created.
