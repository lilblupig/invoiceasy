These stories are addressed fully in the [Testing](TESTING.md) document.

### **Strategy**
Who is the website for?
What does the owner of the website need/want?
What do the users of the website need/want?

Broadly, how does the website meet these needs?

Owner aims:

User aims:

### **Scope**
Why does the website exist?  What does it need to meet the user/owner aims?

## Development Life Cycle

This section is to provide an brief insight into how the approach to the code structure of the website was expected to work, what changed and why, and then to summarise how the creator would now approach replicating the project.

Changes to design are documented in the [UX section](#ux) under [wireframes](#wireframes).

The project was deployed using GitHub pages once the basic structure of the page was complete.  This allowed for continuous delivery as each change was made, and pushed and enabled testing of the page during development on different devices.

Commits were made as each section of each page was added and pushed once a section was complete.

### **Reflections on General Approach to Build**

### **Revised Development Process**

Based on the experience of producing the website, the creator would now take the following approach.

## Deployment

The website was created using [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/). Version control was undertaken by committing to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and pushing to [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the functions within GitPod.  [Heroku]((https://heroku.com/)) was used to deploy the live site.

### **Deployment of the Page**
Continuous deployment via GitHub-Heroku link was utilised for this project.  As such, deployment was amongst the first tasks undertaken.
1. In the IDE, ensure that a small test application exists, and all changes are committed and pushed to GitHub.
1. Create a requirements file, which will be used by Heroku in creation of the deployment.
    * In the terminal, type "pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt".
    * Commit this to Git.
1. Create a Procfile, which is used by Heroku to determine the language for the app.
    * In the terminal, type "echo web: python app.py > Procfile".
    * This is case sensitive, and should have a capital P, and should have no file extension.
    * Commit this to Git.
1. Push these files to GitHub.
1. [Sign in to Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) (or [create a Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/) if you do not already have one), and choose "New > Create New App".
![Heroku Dashboard snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-1.png)
1. Choose an app name, which must be unique, and select the nearest region.  Then click "Create App".
![Heroku new app snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-2.png)
1. Once generated choose the "Deploy" tab, select "Connect to GitHub" sub-tab and click the "Connect to GitHub" button.
![Heroku Deploy snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-3.png)
![Heroku GitHub snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-4.png)
1. Follow the on-screen instructions to link Heroku to your GitHub account.
1. Click the "Settings" tab from the main menu, and scroll down to find "Reveal Config Vars".  This section should be populated with any sensitive data which is not appropriate to send to GitHub, usually in an "env.py" document.
![Heroku GitHub snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-vars.png)
1. Back on the Deploy tab, once linked, Heroku will prompt for the repository name, complete this and click "Search".
![Heroku GitHub snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-5.png)
1. The repo listing should appear, click "Connect".
1. Heroku will process the request before showing that the connection has been made successfully, and showing two new options.  Click the first of these, which is to "Enable Automatic Deploys".
![Heroku GitHub snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-6.png)
1. The second option is to "Deploy Branch".  Click the button and Heroku will process for some time.
![Heroku GitHub snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-7.png)
1. Once complete, Heroku will display a checklist, followed by a "View" button.  Click this to open the app in a new tab.
![Heroku GitHub snip](documentation/readme-images/heroku-8.png)
1. Celebrate! Your app should now update in line with any changes pushed to GitHub.

### **How to Clone and Run the Code Locally**
There are slightly different approaches should you choose to use GitPod to clone the project, or a local IDE.

#### Cloning a Project into GitPod
1. Use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/). *(This can also be undertaken in Firefox)*
1. If you do not already have one, [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
1. Install the [GitPod browser extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki). *(Or Firefox if appropriate)*
1. Restart Chrome.
1. In GitHub, find the [project repository](https://github.com/ci-14-task-manager).
1. From the repository menu, choose the green GitPod button.
![GitPod button snip](documentation/readme-images/cloning-gitpod.png)
1. A new GitPod workspace will open containing the project code.

#### Cloning a Project into a Local IDE
1. Navigate to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ci-14-task-manager).
1. Choose the Code dropdown menu, and copy the URL.
![GitHub code download snip](documentation/readme-images/clone-local-ide.png)
1. Open your local IDE and then open a terminal.
1. Set the current working directory to your preferred location for the cloned project.
1. Type in "git clone " followed by the copied URL. Be sure to include a space between git clone and the url, then press enter.
1. The cloned project will be created.

You can find more information on cloning a repository from GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
